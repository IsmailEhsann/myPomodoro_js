# Pomodoro Timer

This is my very first Javascript project! I wanted to create something simple, but something i'd actively use and because i'm still currently a student, I find myself studying with a pomodoro timer frequently increase my focus. So I wanted to create something that I would frequently use, but also something i'd want to keep improving, whether its the visual aspect or even adding more functionality.
